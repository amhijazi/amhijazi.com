 I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [NSF Artificial Intelligence Research Institute for Advances in Optimization](https://www.ai4opt.org/) in the Georgia Tech School of Industrial and Systems Engineering working with [Pascal Van Hentenryck](https://sites.gatech.edu/pascal-van-hentenryck/) applying optimzation and machine learning to supply chain problems. 

 I received my PhD in Industrial and Systems Engineering from NC State University where I was advised by [Osman Ozaltin](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/oyozalti/) and [Reha Uzsoy](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/ruzsoy/). During my PhD, I worked on optimal resource allocation in healthcare and production systems.  Methods include stochastic programming, combinatorial optimization and machine learning. Specific applications include risk-averse vaccine allocation, product transitions in decentralized environments and parallel machine scheduling.

In summer 2020, I did a research internship at Los Alamos National Lab, where I worked with [Hassan Hijazi](https://about.me/hhijazi) on alignment and registration of 3D point-cloud using mathematical optimization.

Before coming to NCSU,  I did my undergrad at the Islamic University of Gaza majoring in Industrial Engineering.
